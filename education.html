             <li> <h3>data structure: by Mr amit bhagat sir </h3>
                 <br> my expectation :- Introduction
                 Data Structure can be defined as the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the computer so that it can be used efficiently. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. Data Structures are widely used in almost every aspect of Computer Science i.e. Operating System, Compiler Design, Artifical intelligence, Graphics and many more. Data Structures are the main part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. It plays a vitle role in enhancing the performance of a software or a program as the main function of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible
                 
                 Book
                 Data Data-Structures-Through-C-Depth
                 My expectations from this Course
                 After studying Data Structures, my problem-solving abilities will improve.</li>
             <br><li><h3> c programming : by Mr anirban choudhary sir</h3> <br>  my expectation :-Introduction
                'C' was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. It is a robust language. It is a low programming level language close to machine language It is widely used in the software development field. It is a procedure and structure oriented language. It has the full support of various operating systems and hardware platforms. Many compilers are available for executing programs written in 'C'. A compiler compiles the source file and generates an object file. A linker links all the object files together and creates one executable file. It is highly portable.
                
                C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.
                
                Book
                C-Depth-Deepali-Srivastava
                My expectations from this Course
                learning 'C' as the main language will help me learn other programming languages, as it shares the same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements and many more. It is a simple language and provides faster execution.

             <br><li> <h3>business communication: by Ms.jain anjuli<h3> <br>
                my expectation:-Introduction
                Business communication is used to promote a product, service, or organization; relay information within a business; or deal with legal and similar issues. It encompasses a variety of topics including: consumer behavior, advertising, public relations, corporate communication, research and measurement, reputation management, and event management. Business communication may also refer to internal communication: a communications director will typically manage internal communication and craft messages sent to employees. It is vital that internal communications are managed properly because a poorly crafted message could foster distrust or hostility among employees.

             <br><li> <h3>maths : manoj jha sir</h3> <br>my expectation:-Introduction
                Discrete mathematics is mathematics that deals with discrete objects. Discrete objects are those which are separated from (not connected to/distinct from) each other. Integers (aka whole numbers), rational numbers (ones that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers), automobiles, houses, people etc.

              my expectation :-Introduction
              Computer Organization and Architecture Tutorial provides in-depth knowledge of internal working, structuring, and implementation of a computer system. Whereas, Organization defines the way the system is structured so that all those catalogued tools can be used properly. Our Computer Organization and Architecture Tutorial includes all topics of such as introduction, ER model, keys, relational model, join operation, SQL, functional dependency, transaction, concurrency control, etc.
